  <p style="font-size: 16px">
    Hello! My name is [d͡ʒuheɪ kʰɪm] (or [kim tɕuhɛ] in Korean), and I am a 3rd year
    Linguistics PhD student at Cornell University. My broad research interests are
    in semantics/pragmatics, with a particular focus on speech-acts. I am especially
    interested in understanding non-canonical questions, and am currently investigating the
    role of prosody in interpreting Korean information-seeking and rhetorical questions.</p>
    
  <p style="font-size: 16px">Prior to coming to Cornell, I worked as a Post-Baccalaureate Associate at
    Yale University, where I worked with Dr. Claire Bowern on various Australian
    indigenous language projects. I received my B.A. in Linguistics at Swarthmore College.
