    Hello! I am a 3rd year Linguistics PhD student at Cornell University.
    My broad research interests are in semantics/pragmatics, with a particular
    focus on speech-acts. I am especially interested in understanding how
    non-canonical questions are represented and interpreted, and am currently
    investigating the role of prosody in Korean rhetorical questions.
    
    Prior to coming to Cornell, I worked as a Post-Baccalaureate Associate at
    Yale University, where I worked with Dr. Claire Bowern on various Australian
    indigenous language projects. I received my B.A. in Linguistics at Swarthmore College.
